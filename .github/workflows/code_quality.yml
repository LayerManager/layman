          # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
          #    E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3. These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.
          #    F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python. Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case. These are areas where a == b is True but a is b is False (or vice versa).
          #    F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints
          #    F82 tests are almost always undefined names which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3. These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a NameError is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.
