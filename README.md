# layman
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jirik/layman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jirik/layman)

Publishing geospatial data online through [REST API](doc/rest.md).

- Two publication models available:
  - [**layer**](doc/models.md#layer): visual representation of single vector dataset (i.e. ShapeFile or GeoJSON)
  - [**map**](doc/models.md#map): collection of layers
- Accepts data in [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [ShapeFile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), [Styled Layer Descriptor](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld), [Symbology Encoding](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/se), or [HSLayers Map Composition](https://github.com/hslayers/hslayers-ng/wiki/Composition-schema) format
- Even large files can be easily uploaded from browser thanks to asynchronous chunk upload
- Asynchronous processing
- Each vector dataset is automatically imported into PostGIS database
- Provides URL endpoints
  - [Web Map Service (WMS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms)
  - [Web Feature Service (WFS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs)
  - [Catalogue Service (CSW)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat)
  - thumbnail image
- Documented [REST API](doc/rest.md)
- Documented [security system](doc/security.md)
- Documented [data storage](doc/data-storage.md)
- Configurable by environment variables
- Standing on the shoulders of Docker, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GDAL, GeoServer, OpenLayers, Celery, Redis, and [more](doc/dependencies.md)
- Inspired by [CCSS-CZ/layman](https://github.com/CCSS-CZ/layman)


## Requirements
- at least 3 GB RAM
- at least 5 GB disk space
- docker v17.12+, installation instructions for [centos 7](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
- docker-compose v1.14+, installation instructions for [centos 7](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-centos-7)

**Optionally**
- linux or any tool to run tasks defined in Makefile using `make` command
   - can be replaced by running commands defined in [Makefile](Makefile) directly
- git
   - can be replaced by downloading ZIP archive of the repository


## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jirik/layman.git
cd layman
# checkout the latest release in current branch
git checkout $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
```


## Run
There are following ways how to run Layman:
- [demo](#run-demo): the easiest and recommended way how to start layman for demonstration purposes 
- [development](#run-in-development): run layman in development mode
- [test](#test): run automatic tests
- [production](#run-in-production): run layman in production, requires installation of [external dependencies](#dependencies) and manual [configuration](#configuration)


## Run demo
This is the easiest way how to start layman for demonstration purposes. It includes also [external dependencies](#dependencies). However it's not meant for production and it's **not safe** for production. Performance might be also an issue.

```bash
# use demo settings
cp .env.demo .env

# start dockerized containers in background
make start-demo-full
```
Initial startup may take few minutes (download docker images, build it, run it). You are interested in container named `layman`. You can check it's logs with command
```bash
docker logs -f layman
```
Wait until you see something like
```

[2019-10-30 13:45:36 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
[2019-10-30 13:45:36 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (1)
[2019-10-30 13:45:36 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2019-10-30 13:45:36 +0000] [12] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12
```

Then visit [http://localhost/](). You will see simple web client that interacts with [REST API](doc/rest.md).

To stop running service, run `make stop-demo`.


## Configuration
Layman's source code provides settings suitable for development, testing and demo purposes. Furthermore, there exists [`Makefile`](Makefile) with predefined commands for each purpose including starting all necessary services (both in background and foreground) and stoping it.

Layman's configuration is split into three levels:
- `docker-compose.*.yml` files used as [docker-compose configuration files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) with most general settings of docker containers including volume mappings, port mappings, container names and startup commands
- `.env*` files with environment settings of both build stage and runtime of docker containers
- `src/layman_settings*.py` Python modules with settings of Layman's Python modules for runtime

Files at all three levels are suffixed with strings that indicates what they are intended to:
- `demo` to [demonstration purposes](#run-demo)
- `dev` to [development](#run-in-development)
- `test` to [automatic tests](#test)
- `deps` to [external dependencies](#dependencies)

When you are switching between different contexts (e.g. between demo and dev), always check that you are using settings intended for your context, especially
- `.env*` file (check `env_file` properties in `docker-compose.*.yml` file)

Also, anytime you change `.env` file, remember to rebuild docker images as some environment variables affect build stage of docker images. Particularly these environment settings:
- [UID_GID](doc/env-settings.md#UID_GID)
- [LAYMAN_GS_HOST](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_GS_HOST)
- [LAYMAN_GS_PORT](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_GS_PORT)
- [LAYMAN_SERVER_NAME](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_SERVER_NAME)
- [LAYMAN_CLIENT_VERSION](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_CLIENT_VERSION)


## Dependencies
Layman has [many dependencies](doc/dependencies.md). Most of them is shipped with Layman. However there are some **external dependencies** that should be treated carefully:
- PostgreSQL & PostGIS
- GeoServer
- Redis
- Micka

These external dependencies are shipped with Layman for development, testing and demo purposes. They are grouped in `docker-compose.deps*.yml` files.

However, if you want to run Layman in production, it is strongly recommended to install external dependencies separately. Recommended (i.e. tested) versions are:
- PostgreSQL 10.0 & PostGIS 2.4
- GeoServer 2.13.0
- Redis 4.0
- Micka 2020.014 (versions >=2020.010 probably work too)


## Run in production
To run layman in production, you need to provide [external dependencies](#dependencies) and [configure](#configuration) layman manually.

When providing **external dependencies**, check their production-related documentation:
- [PostgreSQL 10.0](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/admin.html) & [PostGIS 2.4](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.4/performance_tips.html)
- [GeoServer 2.13.0](https://docs.geoserver.org/2.13.0/user/production/index.html#production)
- [Redis 4.0](https://redis.io/topics/admin)
- [Micka v2020.014](https://github.com/hsrs-cz/Micka/releases/tag/v2020.014), see also [configuration](deps/micka/sample/confs/config.local.neon) of [dockerized Micka](https://github.com/jirik/docker-micka).

Within PostgreSQL, you need to provide one database for Layman and one database for Micka. For Layman, you also need to provide one user [LAYMAN_PG_USER](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_PG_USER) who needs enough privileges to create new schemas in [LAYMAN_PG_DBNAME](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_PG_DBNAME) database. The user also needs access to `public` schema where PostGIS must be installed.

Within GeoServer, you need to provide either admin password [GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD](doc/env-settings.md#GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD), or one Layman user [LAYMAN_GS_USER](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_GS_USER) and one layman role [LAYMAN_GS_ROLE](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_GS_ROLE). If admin password is provided, Layman will create the Layman user and the Layman role automatically.

Within Redis, you need to provide two databases, one for Layman, second for Layman Test Client. Connection strings are defined by [LAYMAN_REDIS_URL](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_REDIS_URL) and [LTC_REDIS_URL](doc/env-settings.md#LTC_REDIS_URL).

Within Micka, you need to provide one user with editor privileges, whose credentials are defined by [CSW_BASIC_AUTHN](doc/env-settings.md#CSW_BASIC_AUTHN).

After providing external dependencies there is time to provide **internal dependencies** (system-level, python-level and node.js-level dependencies). You can either use our docker and docker-compose configuration to generate docker images that already provides internal dependencies, or you can provide internal dependencies by yourself (if you prefer not to use docker in production).

**System-level** dependencies includes
- python 3.6+
- [python3-lxml](https://lxml.de/installation.html)
- [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html) utility of [gdal](https://gdal.org/) 2.4+
- [chromium-browser](https://chromium.org/) 77+ and corresponding version of [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
- [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 10 & npm 6 for running Timgen
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 12 & npm 6 for running Layman Test Client

Pipenv is recommended tool for installing **python-level** dependencies. Both Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are located in [`docker/`](docker/) directory.

Npm is recommended tool for installing **node.js-level** dependencies. Both package.json and package-lock.json are located in [`timgen/`](timgen/) directory.

Next you need to choose how you deploy Layman. As Layman is Flask application, check Flask's [deployment options](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/). Layman is safe to run with multiple WSGI Flask processes and with multiple Celery worker processes.

Configure Layman using [environment settings](doc/env-settings.md). Demo configuration is a good starting point to setup Layman for production, however it needs to be adjusted carefully. First focus for example on
- [LAYMAN_SETTINGS_MODULE](doc/env-settings.md#LAYMAN_SETTINGS_MODULE)
- [FLASK_APP](doc/env-settings.md#FLASK_APP)
- [FLASK_ENV](doc/env-settings.md#FLASK_ENV) (should be set to `production`)
- [FLASK_SECRET_KEY](doc/env-settings.md#FLASK_SECRET_KEY)
- [LTC_SESSION_SECRET](doc/env-settings.md#LTC_SESSION_SECRET)

Last, start layman and necessary services:
- thumbnail image generator (Timgen) using npm (see startup command of `timgen` docker-compose service)
- Layman client using npm (see startup command of `layman_client` docker-compose service)
- Layman using your deployment server (see startup command of `layman` docker-compose service)
- Layman celery worker using python (see startup command of `celery_worker` docker-compose service)

## Run in development
Suitable for **development only**.

Before the first run:
```bash
# use dev settings
cp .env.dev .env

```

Now everything is ready to start:
```bash
# start all needed dockerized containers 
make start-dev
```
Initial startup may take few minutes (download docker images, build it, run it). Wait until you see something like
```
layman       |  * Serving Flask app "src/layman/layman.py" (lazy loading)
layman       |  * Environment: development
layman       |  * Debug mode: on
layman       |  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
layman       |  * Restarting with stat
layman       |  * Debugger is active!
layman       |  * Debugger PIN: 103-830-055
```
Then visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). You will see simple web client that interacts with [REST API](doc/rest.md).

To stop running service, press Ctrl+C.


### Mount some volumes as non-root user
By default, docker run all containers as **root** user. It's possible to change it by defining `UID_GID` permanent environment variable. First stop all running containers:
```bash
make stop-dev 
```
The `UID_GID` variable should look like `"<user id>:<group id>"` of current user, e.g. `UID_GID="1000:1000"`. As it should be permanent, you can solve it for example by adding following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```
export UID_GID="1000:1000"
```
and restart terminal. Verification:
```bash
$ echo $UID_GID
1000:1000
```
Then change ownership of some directories
```bash
make prepare-dirs
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 layman_data/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 layman_data_test/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 src/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 tmp/
```
and restart layman
```bash
make start-dev
```


## Test
