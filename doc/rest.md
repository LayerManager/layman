#### REST path parameters
- **workspace_name**, string `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$`
   - string identifying [workspace](models.md#workspace)
  
**_NOTE:_** Before version 1.10.0, workspace-related endpoints did not include `/workspaces` in their path. These old endpoints are still functional, but deprecated. More specifically, they return HTTP header **Deprecation**. If you get such header in response, rewrite your client to use new endpoint path. Old endpoints will stop working in the next major release.

## Layers
### URL
`/rest/layers`

### GET Layers
Get list of published layers.

#### Request
Query parameters:
- *full_text_filter*: String. Only layers satisfying any of following conditions are returned:
  - Any word from input string appears in title. Search is case-insensitive, unaccent and does lemmatization for English.
  - Input string appears as substring of title. Search is case-insensitive and unaccent.
- *bbox_filter*: String. Bounding box defined by four comma-separated coordinates `minx,miny,maxx,maxy`. Only layers whose bounding box intersects with given bounding box will be returned.
- *bbox_filter_crs*: String. CRS of *bbox_filter*, default value is `EPSG:3857`, has to be one of [LAYMAN_OUTPUT_SRS_LIST](env-settings.md#LAYMAN_OUTPUT_SRS_LIST).
- *order_by*: String. Can be one of these values:
  - `full_text` Layers will be ordered by results of full-text search. Can be used only in combination with *full_text_filter*.
  - `title` Layers will be ordered lexicographically by title value.
  - `last_change` Layers will be ordered by time of last change. Recently updated layers will be first.
  - `bbox` Layers will be ordered by similarity of bounding box with bounding box passed in *ordering_bbox* or *bbox_filter*. Can be used only in combination with  *ordering_bbox* or *bbox_filter*.
  
  If *full_text_filter* is set, default value is `full_text`; if *bbox_filter* is set, default value is `bbox`; otherwise default value is empty string, i.e. no ordering is guaranteed.
- *ordering_bbox*: String. Bounding box defined by four comma-separated coordinates `minx,miny,maxx,maxy`. The bounding box will be used for ordering. Can be used only if *order_by* is set to `bbox` (by default or explicitly). If *order_by* is set to `bbox`, default value of *ordering_bbox* is the value of *bbox_filter*.
- *ordering_bbox_crs*: String. CRS of *ordering_bbox*, default value is *bbox_filter_crs* if defined otherwise `EPSG:3857`, has to be one of [LAYMAN_OUTPUT_SRS_LIST](env-settings.md#LAYMAN_OUTPUT_SRS_LIST).
- *limit*: Non-negative Integer. No more layers than this number will be returned. But possibly less, if the query itself yields fewer layers.
- *offset*: Non-negative Integer. Says to skip that many layers before beginning to return layers.

Value of `range_end` is one-based index of the last layer within the full list, or zero if no values are returned. Example: `items 1-20/247`.

## Workspace Layers
### URL
`/rest/workspaces/<workspace_name>/layers`

### GET Workspace Layers
Get list of published layers.

Have the same request parameters and response structure and headers as [GET Layers](#get-layers).

### POST Workspace Layers
Publish vector or raster data as new WMS layer, in case of vector data also new WFS feature type.

Processing chain consists of few steps:
- save files (if sent) to workspace directory within Layman data directory
- save basic information (name, title, access_rights) into PostgreSQL
- for vector layers import vector file (if sent) to PostgreSQL database as new table into workspace schema
  - files with invalid byte sequence are first converted to GeoJSON, then cleaned with iconv, and finally imported to database.
- for raster layers normalize and compress raster file to GeoTIFF with overviews (pyramids); NoData values are normalized as transparent
- save bounding box into PostgreSQL
- for vector layers publish the vector table as new layer (feature type) within appropriate WFS workspaces of GeoServer
- for vector layers
  - for layers with SLD or none style:
    - publish the table as new layer (feature type) within appropriate WMS workspaces of GeoServer
  - for layers with QML style:
    - create QGS file on QGIS server filesystem with appropriate style
    - publish the layer on GeoServer through WMS cascade from QGIS server
- for raster layers publish normalized GeoTIFF as new layer (coverage) on GeoServer WMS workspace
- generate thumbnail image
- publish metadata record to Micka (it's public if and only if read access is set to EVERYONE)
- update thumbnail of each [map](models.md#map) that points to this layer

If workspace directory, database schema, GeoServer's workspaces, or GeoServer's datastores does not exist yet, it is created on demand.

Response to this request may be returned sooner than the processing chain is finished to enable [asynchronous processing](async-tasks.md). Status of processing chain can be seen using [GET Workspace Layer](#get-workspace-layer) and **layman_metadata.publication_status** property or **status** properties of layer sources (wms, wfs, thumbnail, db_table, file, style, metadata) for higher granularity.

It is possible to upload data files asynchronously, which is suitable for large files. This can be done in three steps:
1. Send POST Workspace Layers request with **file** parameter filled by file names that you want to upload
2. Read set of files accepted to upload from POST Workspace Layers response, **files_to_upload** property. The set of accepted files will be either equal to or subset of file names sent in **file** parameter.
3. Send [POST Workspace Layer Chunk](#post-workspace-layer-chunk) requests using Resumable.js to upload files.

Check [Asynchronous file upload](async-file-upload.md) example.

   - it is allowed to publish time-series layer by setting time_regex parameter and sending one or more main raster files (compressed in one archive or uncompressed) with the same extension, color interpretation, pixel size, nodata value, mask flags, and data type name. Filename can be at most 210 characters long. Supported characters are 26 Latin letters `a-zA-Z` (with or without diacritics), numbers, underscores, dashes, dots, and spaces. Other Latin characters (e.g. ligatures `Ã` or `Ã`) and other than Latin scripts (e.g. Cyrillic or Chinese) are not supported. Files are stored and published with slugified filenames (diacritic is removed from letters, and space ` ` is converted to underscore `_`).
   - if file names are provided, files must be uploaded subsequently using [POST Workspace Layer Chunk](#post-workspace-layer-chunk)
   - in case of raster data input, following input combinations of bands and color interpretations are supported:
      - 1 band: Gray
      - 1 band: Palette
      - 2 bands: Gray, Alpha

      - 3 bands: Red, Green, Blue
      - 4 bands: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
   - if published file has empty bounding box (i.e. no features), its bounding box on WMS/WFS endpoint is set to the whole World
   - attribute names are [laundered](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/pg.html#layer-creation-options) to be safely stored in DB
   - if QML style is used in this request, it must list all attributes contained in given data file
- *external_table_uri*, string
   - exactly one of `file` or `external_table_uri` must be set
   - [connection URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6) is required, usual format is `postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>?schema=<schema_name>&table=<table_name>&geo_column=<geo_column_name>`
     - `host` part and query parameters `schema` and `table` are mandatory
     - URI scheme is required to be `postgresql`
   - if `geo_column` is not specified, first geometry column of the table by alphabetic order is used
   - published table is required to have one-column primary key
   - names of schema, table and all columns of the table are required to match regular expression `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*$`

     - `SELECT` on `public.geometry_columns` schema
     - `EXECUTE` or `USAGE` on PostGIS functions and types
   - the parameter is not meant to publish tables from Layman's database [LAYMAN_PG_DBNAME](env-settings.md#layman_pg_dbname); such usage can easily damage Layman's database, so do it only at **your own risk!**
- *name*, string
   - computer-friendly identifier of the layer
   - must be unique among all layers of one workspace
   - by default, it is file name without extension
     - for layers with more than one main file, it is the first one in alphabetic order
     - for layers published from external table, it is table name
   - maximal length is 210 characters
   - will be automatically adjusted using `to_safe_layer_name` function
- *title*, string `.+`
   - human readable name of the layer
   - by default it is layer name
- *description*
   - by default it is empty string

   - supported only for layers with file source
   - CRS of the file
   - by default it is read/guessed from input file
- *style*, style file
   - by default either default SLD style of GeoServer, or customized SLD created by Layman is used
     - default customized SLD file is created only for grayscale raster input files with or without alpha band to stabilize contrast in WMS; [ColorMap with type `ramp`](https://docs.geoserver.org/2.21.x/en/user/styling/sld/reference/rastersymbolizer.html#colormap) is used
   - SLD or QML style file (recognized by the root element of XML: `StyledLayerDescriptor` or `qgis`)
     - QML style for raster data file is not supported
     - It's possible to encode also external images in QML styles and use them in the style. To do so, each image needs to be encoded in Base64 encoding inside QML file. You can achieve it by selecting "Embed File" option in QGIS Layer Symbology window, see e.g. QGIS issues [2815](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/2815) or [4563](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/4563).
   - uploading of additional style files, e.g. point-symbol images or fonts is not supported

- ~~sld~~, SLD file
   - **deprecated parameter**
   - alias for *style* parameter
- *overview_resampling*, string
   - supported only for raster layers
   - method used by [`gdaladdo`](https://gdal.org/programs/gdaladdo.html#cmdoption-gdaladdo-r) for overview resampling when normalizing raster layer
   - by default Layman will guess overview resampling method from input file metadata
   - supported values are: `nearest`, `average`, `rms`, `bilinear`, `gauss`, `cubic`, `cubicspline`, `lanczos`, `average_magphase` and `mode`
- *time_regex*, string, e.g. `[0-9]{8}T[0-9]{6}Z`
  - regular expression pattern used for extracting the time information from [timeseries](models.md#timeseries) raster file names. The pattern
    - either has no matching group and matches ISO 8601 [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Years), [date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates), or [datetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) patterns, e.g. `[0-9]{8}` or `[0-9]{8}T[0-9]{6}Z`
    - or has one or more matching groups that concatenated together matches ISO 8601 year, date, or datetime patterns, e.g. `^some_prefix_([0-9]{8})_some_postfix.*$` or , e.g. `some_prefix_([0-9]{8})_some_separator_(T[0-9]{6}Z)_some_postfix`
  - latin diacritic is removed from the regex and spaces are replaced with underscores to be consistent with slugifying of timeseries filenames
  - error is raised if any of main data file names do not match *time_regex* value

### PATCH Workspace Layer
Update information about existing layer. First, it deletes sources of the layer (except external DB table published using `external_table_uri`), and then it publishes them again with new parameters. The processing chain is similar to [POST Workspace Layers](#post-workspace-layers).

Response to this request may be returned sooner than the processing chain is finished to enable [asynchronous processing](async-tasks.md).

It is possible to upload data files asynchronously, which is suitable for large files. See [POST Workspace Layers](#post-workspace-layers).

Calling concurrent PATCH requests is not supported, as well as calling PATCH when [POST/PATCH async chain](async-tasks.md) is still running, is not allowed. In such cases, error is returned.

Calling PATCH request when [WFS-T async chain](async-tasks.md) is still running causes abortion of WFS-T async chain and ensures another run of WFS-T async chain after PATCH async chain is finished.

#### Request

## Workspace Layer Chunk
Layer Chunk endpoint enables to upload layer data files asynchronously by splitting them into small parts called *chunks* that are uploaded independently. The endpoint is expected to be operated using [Resumable.js](https://github.com/23/resumable.js/) library. Resumable.js can split and upload files by chunks using [HTML File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), widely [supported by major browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fileapi).

Check [Asynchronous file upload](async-file-upload.md) example. 

The endpoint is activated after [POST Workspace Layers](#post-workspace-layers) or [PATCH Workspace Layer](#patch-workspace-layer) request if and only if the **file** parameter contained file name(s). The endpoint is active till first of the following happens:
- all file chunks are uploaded
- no chunk is uploaded within [UPLOAD_MAX_INACTIVITY_TIME](../src/layman_settings.py)
- layer is deleted

### URL

## Workspace Maps
### URL
`/rest/workspaces/<workspace_name>/maps`

### GET Workspace Maps
Get list of published maps (map compositions).

Have the same request parameters and response structure and headers as [GET Maps](#get-maps).

### POST Workspace Maps
Publish new map composition. Accepts JSON valid against [map-composition schema](https://github.com/hslayers/map-compositions) version 2 used by [Hslayers-ng](https://github.com/hslayers/hslayers-ng). Exact version of schema is defined by `describedBy` key of JSON data file.

Processing chain consists of few steps:
- validate JSON file against schema defined by `describedBy` key
- save file to workspace directory
- if needed, update some JSON attributes (`name`, `title`, or `abstract`)
- generate thumbnail image
- publish metadata record to Micka (it's public if and only if read access is set to EVERYONE)
- save basic information (name, title, access_rights) into PostgreSQL

Some of these steps run [asynchronously](async-tasks.md).

If workspace directory does not exist yet, it is created on demand.

Response to this request may be returned sooner than the processing chain is finished to enable asynchronous processing. Status of processing chain can be seen using [GET Workspace Map](#get-workspace-map) and **layman_metadata.publication_status** property or **status** properties of map sources (file, thumbnail, metadata) for higher granularity.
