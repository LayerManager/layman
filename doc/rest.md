## Layers
### URL
`/rest/<username>/layers`

### GET Layers
Get list of published layers.

#### Request
No action parameters.
#### Response
Content-Type: `application/json`

JSON array of objects representing available layers with following structure:
- **name**: String. Name of the layer.
- **uuid**: String. UUID of the layer.
- **url**: String. URL of the layer. It points to [GET Layer](#get-layer).

### POST Layers
Publish vector data file as new layer of WMS and WFS.

Processing chain consists of few steps:
- save file to user directory within Layman data directory
- import the file to PostgreSQL database as new table into user schema, including geometry transformation to EPSG:3857
- publish the table as new layer (feature type) within user workspace of GeoServer
- generate thumbnail image
- publish metadata record to Micka

If user directory, database schema, GeoServer's worskpace, or GeoServer's datastore does not exist yet, it is created on demand.

Response to this request may be returned sooner than the processing chain is finished to enable asynchronous processing. Status of processing chain can be seen using [GET Layer](#get-layer) and **status** properties of layer sources (wms, wfs, thumbnail, db_table, file, sld, metadata).

It is possible to upload data files asynchronously, which is suitable for large files. This can be done in three steps:
1. Send POST Layers request with **file** parameter filled by file names that you want to upload
2. Read set of files accepted to upload from POST Layers response, **files_to_upload** property. The set of accepted files will be either equal to or subset of file names sent in **file** parameter.
3. Send [POST Layer Chunk](#post-layer-chunk) requests using Resumable.js to upload files.

Check [Asynchronous file upload](async-file-upload.md) example.

#### Request

Body parameters:
- **file**, file(s) or file name(s)

      - GeoJSON file
      - ShapeFile files (at least three files: .shp, .shx, .dbf)
      - file names, i.e. array of strings
   - if file names are provided, files must be uploaded subsequently using [POST Layer Chunk](#post-layer-chunk)
- *name*, string
   - computer-friendly identifier of the layer
   - must be unique among all layers of one workspace
   - by default, it is file name without extension
   - will be automatically adjusted using `to_safe_layer_name` function
- *title*, string `.+`
   - human readable name of the layer
   - by default it is layer name
- *description*
   - by default it is empty string
- *crs*, string `EPSG:3857` or `EPSG:4326`
   - CRS of the file
   - by default it is read/guessed from input file
- *sld*, SLD file
   - by default default SLD style of GeoServer is used
   - uploading of additional style files, e.g. point-symbol images or fonts is not supported

   - **layman_original_parameter**: name of the request parameter that contained the file name; currently, the only possible value is `file`
